# @version ^0.3.0

# ManagedAccess: Access control base contract
# Provides owner and manager roles with authorization checks
# Note: In Vyper 0.3, we use this as a reference pattern
# Each contract implements owner and manager directly

# This file serves as a template/reference for access control patterns
# Actual implementation is done in each contract that needs access control
